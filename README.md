# Flask Joke API

This is a Flask-based API that generates jokes based on different categories using the GPT-2 model. The API allows users to request jokes in various categories like tech, puns, animals, kids, dad jokes, and work-related humor.

## Features

- **Joke Categories:** Choose from different joke categories such as Tech, Puns, Animals, Kids, Dad Jokes, and Work.
- **Fallback Jokes:** If the model doesn't generate a relevant joke, a predefined fallback joke is provided.
- **Dockerized Deployment:** Easily deploy the API in any environment using Docker.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **Pip package manager**
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized deployment)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-joke-api.git
   cd flask-joke-api
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Flask API:**

   flask run
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

### Requesting a Joke

You can request a joke by category by sending a GET request to the `/generate_joke` endpoint with the `category` query parameter. For example:

   docker build -t flask-jokes-api .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 flask-jokes-api
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000/`.
